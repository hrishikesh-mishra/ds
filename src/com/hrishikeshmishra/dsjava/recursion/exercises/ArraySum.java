/**

 * C-5.24
 *
 * Isabel has an interesting way of summing up the values in an array A of n integers,
 * where n is a power of two. She creates an array B of half the size of A and
 * sets B[i] = A[2i] + A[2i + 1], for i = 0,1,...,(n/2) âˆ’ 1.
 * If B has size 1, then she outputs B[0]. Otherwise, she replaces A with B, and
 * repeats the process. What is the running time of her algorithm?
